### Understanding the Game üéÆ

The Aviator game is a crash-style game where you place bets and watch a
plane take off. Your goal is to cash out before the plane flies too far
and crashes. The longer the plane flies, the higher the multiplier
grows, but waiting too long means you risk losing your bet if the plane
crashes.

### Basic Gameplay Steps:

1.  **Place a Bet**: Before the round starts, decide on how much you
    want to bet.
2.  **Watch the Plane**: The plane takes off and the multiplier starts
    increasing.
3.  **Cash Out**: You can cash out at any point to lock in your
    winnings. If the plane crashes before you cash out, you lose your
    bet.

The key to success in Aviator is knowing when to cash out---patience and
strategy are crucial!
